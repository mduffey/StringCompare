If you've ever needed to match up two strings, and/or check a string's length, have I ever got a solution for you!

Feel free to get all clever with new features. I've given it a basic start. 

Note that you can select text to use the "Should Be" value. It'll show you what the other string is for that selection if they don't match up.
